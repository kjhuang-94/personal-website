### About Makeover Monday
[MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project: "Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart. Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data. We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake. Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).
