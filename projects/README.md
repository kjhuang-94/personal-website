## My Projects


### Data Visualization Projects
#### [#A data analysis case study of COVID-19 in Taiwan](https://kjhuang-94.github.io/personal-website/projects/case%20study%20of%20COVID-19/A%20data%20analysis%20case%20study%20of%20COVID-19%20in%20Taiwan.html)
This case study is my first project after I started learning data science by python through online courses in my spare time.If you are interested in the situation of coronavirus in Taiwan, please feel free to have a look and drop any question. **This report is only for your reference, because I am not an expert in epidemiology.** 
#### #MakeoverMonday
[MakeoverMonday](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/) is a social data project: "Each week we post a link to a chart, and its data, and then you rework the chart. Maybe you retell the story more effectively, or find a new story in the data. We’re curious to see the different approaches you all take. Whether it’s a simple bar chart or an elaborate infographic, we encourage everyone of all skills to partake. Together we can have broader conversations about and with data."

The datasets are published each week at: [MakeoverMonday Datasets](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/).
